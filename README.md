# Healthcare Instruction Prediction Project

## Overview
This project aims to develop a machine learning model that predicts healthcare instructions for patients based on their demographic details, medical history, physical measurements, and other relevant features. The model will analyze patient characteristics and provide recommendations for lifestyle changes and medication instructions based on their health conditions.

## Project Structure
- **Dataset**: The dataset used for this project contains patient information, including age, gender, blood group, height, weight, allergies, medications, surgeries, medical history, blood pressure, cholesterol level, blood sugar level, and prescribed medicines columns.
- **Code Files**:
  - `final_prediction.py`: Python script containing code for data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and prediction.
  - `requirements.txt`: File listing all required Python packages and their versions.
- **Documentation**:
  - `README.md`: This file provides an overview of the project, instructions for setup, usage, and other relevant details.
- **Output**:
  - `predictions.csv`: CSV file containing predicted healthcare instructions for patients.

## Setup
1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/Fayis-PV/Medical-ML-Predictor.git
   ```
2. **Install Dependencies**: Navigate to the project directory and install the required Python packages using pip:
   ```
   cd healthcare-instruction-prediction
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
1. **Prepare Dataset**: Place the dataset file (`finished_edge_dataset.csv`) in the project directory.
2. **Run the Script**: Execute the Python script `final_prediction.py` to preprocess the data, train the model, and generate predictions:
   ```
   python final_prediction.py
   ```
3. **Output**: Once the script completes execution, the predicted healthcare instructions will be saved to the `predictions.csv` file in the output directory.

## Model Evaluation
- The model's performance can be evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- Cross-validation techniques can be employed to assess the model's robustness and generalization ability.

## Future Improvements
- Incorporate additional features or data sources to enhance prediction accuracy.
- Experiment with different machine learning algorithms and hyperparameter tuning techniques to improve model performance.
- Conduct thorough analysis and interpretation of model predictions to identify potential biases or areas for improvement.
